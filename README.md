**Pre-requisites**

You should have the AWS CLI installed [instructions for AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html).

**Analytics Workshop - Fintech Forum, 2021**

**NB**: <span style="color:blue">*If you are performing this lab in your own AWS account, provide the ARN of the admin user or a user that has adequate privileges to execute the steps that follow instead of what has been mentioned as __TeamRole__ in the instructions below.*</span>

1. One of the key aspects of effectively personalizing the customer's experience is the ability to flawlessly and frictionlessly presenting customers hyper-relevant offers. [Research by Accenture and Nomis](https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/accenture/conversion-assets/dotcom/documents/global/pdf/dualpub_20/accenture-retail-bank-pricing-survey.pdf) suggests that fintechs that link pricing to customer lifetime value (CLV) will be better positioned for growth and prosperity.
2. One of the most important processes in determining CLV is the ability to segment your customers. Recency, Frequency, Monetary (RFM) segmentation enables personalized marketing, increases engagement, and enables you to create specific, relevant offers for the right groups of customers. 
3. We will be performing RFM analysis, the approach can be leveraged in banking, especially mobile banking where customers often also engage with merchants through the bank's mobile app, typical inputs to such an analysis may include deposit type, transaction date, balance before transaction, transaction amount etc.. It can also be leveraged with insurance where the input data may include demographic details, term of policy, sum assured, premium, agent etc. [This is a paper that covers various techniques in depth](https://farapaper.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Fardapaper-Customers-Segmentation-in-the-Insurance-Company-TIC-Dataset.pdf).
4. We will be using [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce) for the lab. This dataset should serve as an analogy for transactions in banking, insurance, and other fintechs.
5. Download the dataset by clicking on [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce), use the download button. 
    ![](kaggle-data-download.png)
6. On your browser, navigate to your lab environment's AWS Management Console, next, navigate to the the IAM console and on the left-handside panel click on __Roles__. In the right-hand side panel search for __TeamRole__. Once you find the TeamRole, click to see the details, make a note of the ARN of the role.
7. Run the following commands,
```
git clone https://github.com/OmarKhayyam/ff-analytics-ws.git
``` 
Next, initiate the stack creation for the lab,

```
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name step-1-stack --template-body file://Step-First.yml --parameters ParameterKey=TeamRoleArn,ParameterValue=<ARN of the IAM role TeamRole from step 6> --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```
8. Either upload the downloaded dataset file using the S3 console to the bucket we just created or run the following command,
```
aws s3 cp <location of dataset file> s3://<bucket-name>[/<optional prefix>]
```
Upload the following files to the S3 bucket,
```
olist_customers_dataset.csv
olist_orders_dataset.csv
olist_order_payments_dataset.csv
```
Look at the __Outputs__ of the above created stack to get the bucket name. You can choose the prefix if you like. 

9. Go to the Amazon Redshift management console. From the left-handside panel click on __EDITOR__. Choose to use __Query Editor__ and __NOT__ the __Query Editor V2__.
10. In the Query Editor, click the __Connect to database__ button on the right. In the pop up, choose __Create a new connection__, for Authentication choose __Temporary credentials__. Choose your cluster from the cluster drop-down, enter the database name __workshopredshiftdb__. For user enter __admin__. You should now be connected to the database.
11. Create tables by issuing the following CREATE TABLE commands in the Query Editor,
```
create table if not exists customers_1(
customer_id varchar(40) not null,
customer_unique_id varchar(40) not null,
zip_code char(10),
customer_city varchar(100),
state varchar(3) not null,
primary key(customer_id))
distkey(customer_id)
```
```
create table if not exists orders_1(
order_id varchar(40) not null,
customer_id varchar(40) not null,
order_status varchar(15) not null,
order_purchase_time timestamp not null,
order_approved_at timestamp,
order_delivered_carrier_date timestamp,
order_delivered_customer_date timestamp,
order_estimated_delivery_date timestamp,
primary key(customer_id))
distkey(customer_id)
```
```
create table if not exists payments_1(
order_id varchar(40) not null,
payment_sequential integer,
payment_type varchar(15),
payment_installments integer,
payment_value NUMERIC(10,4),
primary key(order_id))
distkey(order_id)
```

11. Load the data from S3 into a Redshift table using the following COPY commands,
```
copy customers_1 from 's3://<Bucket-Name>/olist_customers_dataset.csv' IGNOREHEADER 1 MAXERROR 10 iam_role '<IAM Role from the Outputs tab in Cloudformation console>' csv;
```
```
copy orders_1 from 's3://<Bucket-Name>/olist_orders_dataset.csv' IGNOREHEADER 1 MAXERROR 10 iam_role '<IAM Role from the Outputs tab in Cloudformation console>' csv;
```
```
copy payments_1 from 's3://<Bucket-Name>/olist_order_payments_dataset.csv' IGNOREHEADER 1 MAXERROR 10 iam_role '<IAM Role from the Outputs tab in Cloudformation console>' csv;
```
12. We now create a table that pulls all the data that is relevant to us together, and prrovides a unified view of the transactions, run the following query to take a brief look at the results,
```
select orders_1.order_id, customers_1.customer_unique_id, orders_1.order_purchase_time, payments_1.payment_value from orders_1 inner join customers_1 on orders_1.customer_id=customers_1.customer_id inner join payments_1 on orders_1.order_id=payments_1.order_id order by orders_1.order_purchase_time asc;
```

To create a table with this data, we use the following query,

```
create table workshopredshiftdb.public.transactions_1 BACKUP YES DISTSTYLE EVEN as select orders_1.order_id, customers_1.customer_unique_id, orders_1.order_purchase_time, payments_1.payment_value from orders_1 inner join customers_1 on orders_1.customer_id=customers_1.customer_id inner join payments_1 on orders_1.order_id=payments_1.order_id order by orders_1.order_purchase_time asc;
```
13. Since, we have now created this table, lets get these transactions together using the following queries,
```
select t.customer_unique_id, t.order_purchase_time, any_value(t.payment_value) as value from transactions_1 as t group by 1,2 order by 2 desc;
```
Use the __CREATE TABLE__ example above to create a similar table if you like, we leave that as on exercise for you. Here on forward, we refer to the resulting table as __rfm_input_1__.

14. Let us create the final RFM table, to create the RFM table, lets run the following query on the data we have so far,
```
create table workshopredshiftdb.public.rfm_input_2 BACKUP YES DISTSTYLE EVEN as select customer_unique_id, ((datediff(week,MAX(order_purchase_time),getdate())-161.0)/(271.0-161.0))*5.0 as "recency", ((COUNT(rfm_input_1.customer_unique_id)-1.0)/(17.0-1.0))*5.0 as "frequency", ((AVG(value)-0)/(13664.08-0))*5.0 as "monetary" from rfm_input_1 group by customer_unique_id;
```
We are calling this table rfm_input_2.

15. On the AWS Management console of your lab environment, navigate to the Amazon SageMaker console. On the left-handside panel got (*click*) to *Notebook*->*Notebook instances*. In the upper right, click on the __Create notebook instance__ button.

16. On the Create Notebook instance page, give the instance a name, choose the ml.c5.xlarge instance type from the drop-down. In __Additional configuration__ set the volume size to 50. For SageMaker execution role, make sure that the role you choose has the following permissions policies attached : __AmazonS3FullAccess__ and __AmazonRedshiftFullAccess__ . Note that these permissions are only for the purpose of this workshop, you should design less permissive policies when deploying this your production, [use the principle of least privilege when creating your execution role](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/techniques-for-writing-least-privilege-iam-policies/). Click the __Create notebook instance__ at the bottom right. Wait for the instance to be __InService__. Click on __Open Jupyter__. For the kernel if not already set, choose __conda_mxnet_p36__.

17. Start executing each cell in the Jupyter Notebook one at a time. Make sure, for each cell, that you have made all the relevant substitutions, typical substitutions you will have to make are for the Amazon Redshift Cluster Identifier, the Amazon S3 bucket and Amazon Redshift IAM role you created when you instantiated the Cloudformation stack in step 7 above.

18. Stop executing the cells in the Jupyter notebook after you get the SageMaker endpoint name. We do __not__ want to cleanup the endpoint just yet. Make a note of the endpoint name and proceed.

**Visualization using Amazon Quicksight**

19. On console search for Quickight and choose to go to Quicksight console. Quicksight account needs to be set up with account ID , mail address for the account and the admin for the account. In the account options, choose QuickSight Enterprise Edition to complete the following steps in this lab. For more information, see [How do I create an Amazon QuickSight Enterprise edition account?](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/quicksight-enterprise-account/)
Choose the same Region that you launched Amazon SageMaker.
Choose Manage QuickSight -> Choose Security & permissions -> Choose Add or remove -> Select Amazon S3 -> Choose Select S3 buckets.

20. Create a dataset in QuickSight with s3 as source : On the QuickSight console, choose Dataset and select 'New Dataset'.Choose S3.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73990292/143077622-34bf4dc4-db3b-428b-abe0-076066316a0b.png)

Using a text editor, create a manifest file (e.g. manifest.json) on local with the following content (replace <bucket_name> and <prefix> with location coordinates for the CSV)
Example : 
```
    {
    "fileLocations": [
        {
            "URIPrefixes": [
                "s3://ff-workshop-wsdatasetbucket-cop9xekm3r64/train_data.CSV"  
            ]
        }
    ],
    "globalUploadSettings": {
        "format": "CSV",
        "delimiter": ",",
        "containsHeader": "true"
    }
}
```                       
21. Upload this file to create the Amazon S3 data source.Choose Edit/Preview data.
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73990292/143078055-7966bdaf-9ed0-43cb-9daf-b7201797b31c.png)

22. To augment your data with the Amazon SageMaker model you built earlier, choose Augment with SageMaker.
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/73990292/143078424-6dc23da0-6b2c-43fd-bfe7-87726a98db68.png)

    Click next -> Add description (if needed) to output fields
Before you use an Amazon SageMaker model with QuickSight data, you have to create a JSON schema file that contains the metadata that QuickSight needs to process the model. It provides metadata about the fields, data types, column order, output, and settings that the model expects, such as type of the instance to use for generating the predictions.   
    Example of Json file for the KMeans model :
```
    {
  "inputContentType": "CSV",
  "outputContentType": "CSV",
  "input": [
    {
      "name": "recency",
      "type": "DECIMAL"
    },
    {
      "name": "frequency",
      "type": "DECIMAL"
    },
    {
      "name": "monetary",
      "type": "DECIMAL"
    }
],
  "output": [
    {
      "name": "Predict_cluster",
      "type": "STRING"
    },
    {
      "name": "Predict_distance_to_cluster",
      "type": "STRING"
    }
  ],
  "description": "description",
  "version": "v1",
  "instanceCount": 1,
  "instanceTypes": [
    "ml.c4.xlarge"
  ],
  "defaultInstanceType": "ml.c4.xlarge"
}
```
    
23. Choose **Prepare data** and 'Save and Visualize'.
    This starts a job in SageMaker to run the inference and adds a new column to your dataset. It can take approximately 4 minutes for the Amazon SageMaker model to run a batch transform job to complete the inference and load the full scored dataset with the Prediction column into [SPICE](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/spice.html).
    
    Go to Analysis and choose the Analysis with dataset. Approx after 4 min SPICE load should be complete with prediction fields

**Clean Up**    

25. Cleanup instructions for Amazon QuickSight : Delete the S3 source dataset and the dashboard. To delete the account go to 'Account settings' from 'Manage Quicksight' and delete account.

26. In the Jupyter notebook, close the notebook, and in the __Files__ tab, click the checkbox against the running notebook and click the __Shutdown__ button. Close the Jupyter notebook tab. In the Amazon SageMaker console, click the radio button against the name of the notebook instance and from the __Actions__ drop down, click __Stop__. Once the instance has stopped, again from the __Actions__ drop-down, click __Delete__.

27. Navigate to the IAM console, click on __Roles__ in the left-handside panel, search for the execution role you used for the SageMaker notebook. Click on the __Delete role__ button at the top right of the page.

28. Now navigate to the cloudformation console. List the stacks, click on the radio button against the stack that we created for this workshop. Click the __Delete__ button at the top of this page.

29. Thank you.
